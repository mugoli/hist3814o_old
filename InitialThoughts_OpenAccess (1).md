A digital current is slowly nudging history towards its existential crisis. Open Access - the belief that research, as well as the research process (via notes) should be made public to all - is at the heart of ongoing debates across the field. One of my classmates managed to grasp the discussion in an annotation :
> This is a dilemma for me: I want historians to share their research, to help other scholars, but I also recognize that even academics have to make a living. If the value of your work is in books sold, it would be very intimidating to open source your ideas against the wishes of your publishing company. ([May 17, 2018][3])

I found this annotation interesting because it posed what fellow students and [experts][6] have highlighted as a main point of contention: *where do we place value in history?* 

##### Value 
If ideas and knowledge are truly popular, then they should be freely accessible to all, and the value should be placed in the contribution to collective knowledge. If, however, ideas and knowledge are *[commodified][7]*, then the value is placed in the "[the scarcity of sources themselves][4]," hence their monetary value, "[rather than just the narratives that we weave with them][4]."

Essentially, the question of whether research notes are proprietary or public forces us to address much more philosophical questions regarding ideas and creativity; why we are creating, and who we are creating for.

This reminds me of the case of [Aaron Swartz][1], the young man who helped create RSS and reddit, among other things. He died by suicide after a long fight to make scholarly journals free to the public - he mass-downloaded JSTOR articles, and made them available for free, was on the run from police because of it, and later took his own life. In his [manifesto][2], he writes that: 
> Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. 

> There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought 
valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. 

> That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. 

Despite its challenges and the real reality that *people need to get paid because they need money to live*, I like the activism that stands behind Open Access. What it might force us to do is not only rethink our relationship to the process of history-making, but also the whole funding model & overall structure of history as a professional field.

(Interestingly enough, I was first introduced to the idea of Open Access through [music][8].)
